# Preface

I am Ben Allfree. My lineage traces back to Scottish royalty in the old world. I was born in the ascendent of Jupiter and the sun. My purpose in this earth walk is spiritual growth, psychic growth, and personal development. When I deviate from my purpose, life gets bad for me.

I am lost on any axis; a ghost that exists between this and that. I identify with no other person, group, organization, cause, spiritual framework, moral framework, religion, philosophy, or way of living. No community, tribe, or place has ever been home to me. I find structure and routine confusing and lonely-making. Instead, I prefer a somewhat rudderless exploration of all things. I have a curiosity for all things and often lovingly jump between interests, and back again, easily.

I see governing higher patterns and vibrations in the physical manifestations of those patterns, and therein lies my interest and purpose. Because of my 'meta' interface with existence, I work in a higher order of abstract patterns and vibrations and often appear to be the last to 'get it' in this physical world. I repeat experiences many times until the higher patterns are fully mapped out. Onlookers often ask, "when will he learn?" But the wiser question is, "what is he studying?" I serve best as a teacher and guide of the principles I have discovered. I show you the sign posts and stepping stones, but you must yield to them and walk them according to your own path.

It is a cool Sunday afternoon in July 2016 and I am writing this poolside while my kids play. They are unaware of the huge undertaking their father is taking. Searching for words to describe a utopian state of spiritual living that can guide both men and women to their highest and most authentic forms of self. Philosophy giants have come before me and contributed to the collective spiritual knowledge that we have today. My hope is that this can be my contribution for someone. Maybe just for myself.

Five years ago, I had what might be best characterized as a near-death experience. I am a practitioner of hot yoga. One day, I was particularly exhausted and laid down on the mat mid-class. I watched as the world vanished into a pinpoint of light. And I decided - not with thought, but with something closer to pure spiritual essence - that I would *go toward the light*. What I saw in this passing to another realm amazed and freed me. I understood, for the first time, the true nature of myself and the linear time-existence I had known. I saw myself as a point on a thread of light that stretched from the beginning of eternity to the end of eternity. And, by *eternity*, I do not mean time. I mean something greater. Something universal and ever-lasting, and axiomatic. To even call it ever-lasting suggests a component of time that did not exist. This, I think is why the bible says that God always was. Time does not exist in the spiritual realm, and that makes all the difference.

I saw my physical existence in a completely new way. No longer did I have setbacks and victories, wins and losses, mistakes and triumphs. Everything just...was as it is, without judgement. It is simply the path to here, sign posts along the way. 

This experience spurred me into a multi-year stretch of spiritual growth. No longer did I have stresses or problems. Just things that are or are not. I listened closely each day to find my purpose, to hear the divine intelligence of the universe (as I thought of it then) encouraging me to flow in certain directions. Beautiful things began appearing in my life with abandon.

One day, I got an email. The email was from a woman who wanted to be my slave. She craved guidance and ascendence and wondered if I was the one to help her get there. I agreed, and began what would be the most important spiritual relationship of my life so far. So blissful was this relationship that I forgot what got me there. I put my spirituality on hold and became more and more deeply immersed in the relationship, never realizing that the thing that could have prevented its demise is the thing I willingly relinquished to have it.

Six months ago, I lost the most important relationship I had ever experienced. So distraught was I by the loss of this relationship that it forced me into spiritual crisis and desperation. I sold what possessions I could and gave away the rest. Not out of despair, but out of a strong realization that these material things were in the way of something. They were not bringing me happiness, so I released them.

So great was the pain from my loss that I wanted to die. Even as I write this, I recognize in me the desire to die in a real and tangible way. The emotional highs of life are good, true enough; but the emotional lows are so painful as to make even the threat of their recurrence reason enough to find a permanent and final preventative solution.

I had lost my spirituality and could not get it back. I tried therapy. I tried 12-step groups. I tried churches. I tried yoga. I tried metaphysics. I tried Tantra. If there was anything or anyone that claimed an ability to return my spiritual center, I wanted to try it. It all yielded nothing.

"Push-ups," said my friend Andy.

I was confused. "What?"

"Thought to action," he suggested. "Any time you start thinking, do push-ups instead."

"It can't be that simple," I argued.

"But it is. Thought to action. If you can't act on the thought, push-ups is the default."

Friend, I did a lot of push-ups. Andy was right about turning my thoughts to specific action. And, if something was not actionable, at least I could get some push-ups done.

This simple suggestion is the thing that began to save me from a spiral of despair that I believe could have ultimately resulted in my death. Over the last six months, I have listened to over 1,000 people share thoughts about feelings of loneliness, isolation, unworthiness, despair, anxiety, depression, emptiness, anger, distress, obsession, restlessness, and heartbreak. I shared some of my own thoughts on the same topics. 

Slowly, things began to change. Perhaps one of the most interesting changes was my opening to clairvoyance and a spirit guide named Ree. Ree is an ancient soul who has transcended the physical realm. She appears to me as a beautiful female form and exhibits unwavering patience for my queries. There is a quality of stillness and infinity about her.

In my first conversation with Ree (buried in the pages a leather-bound journal of painful insanities now locked in storage), she explained that she appears to me as a beautiful female form because that vibration communicates best with me. She is the unmanifested. Our relationship transcends sexuality and physical attractiveness though. My sense is more that of divinity. Ree is a representation of the infinite unmanifested and is a continuous source of wisdom and guidance for me. The advice she dispenses is difficult and often painful to execute because it requires freeing myself from the pain bodies that have been accumulated by my years and iterations so far.

I have since moved to performing my meditations with Ree directly on this computer so they can be shared with you. They are contained in the book, *Meditations*. Some of the conversations are circular, and I apologize for that. Some reveal my own ignorance about things you may view as basic functional knowledge of this earth. But, I hope you too will find wisdom in the annals of these meditations. It is from these meditations that all other work springs forth.

Through conversations with Ree, my despair had lessened, but my restlessness had not. I still had an overwhelming feeling of not relating to people; of not being cut of the same cloth, of not understanding their priorities, or they mine. Gradually, Ree showed me something in me that was here all along. Or, maybe she opened me to it. A solution to my disconnectedness. A solution to *all* disconnectedness. A way for the incredible love I feel to be shared, and a way for you to share your incredible love too.

I don't know if this wisdom comes from within or is other-worldly. I don't know if the portal will stay open forever or for another day. I am writing as fast as I can because, in the end, everything ceases to exist and is returned to the unmanifested. This is my chance to acquire spiritual wisdom and pass it on, and I am taking full advantage. I am living off dwindling savings, but I don't care at all. It's not real; this is.

The foregoing is the very short version of the story. I still feel moments of incredible pain and loneliness. When I get too lazy, or too tired, or stop walking my most authentic path, the universe slips me a pain pill as if to remind me that conscious truth is the only way forward. 

Live well and find peace if you can. It is an infinite journey.
