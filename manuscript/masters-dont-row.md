# Masters Don't Row

> I like to think that Master and I are in a boat together. On most days, I row and Master steers. He decides what is to be done, or where we will go, and I provide him the power to get us there. Master chooses the route, he makes sure the way is clear, and I tend to it. That relationship is the one that works best, the one where I am happiest too. I don't have to worry about whether the direction is right or wrong, I just happily row.
But every once in a while, I start thinking. I get clever. I get *smart*. I say, "Master, this is working pretty well. Why don't we switch for a while? How about you row and I'll steer?" And so I stop rowing. The boat stalls and settles adrift, aimlessly. "Master," I exclaim, "you have to row now! We are adrift!" And Master answers gently, "Master doesn't row."
So you see, when I get a mind to think how things should be, or where we should be going, what we should be doing, how I should be treated, or anything else, we just go nowhere because Master doesn't row. My ideas do have power and value, but only through Master when he steers and I row.

 The above is a meaningful and real story. It contains a lot of wisdom. As Master, your role is to choose the path and clear obstacles from it. Your slave will test her boundaries both intentionally and untentionally. She may at times complain that the path is not clear, when in fact it's just that the path is not easy. Your slave may, at times, become critical of the path you have chosen or what you have commanded her to do.
 
First, it would be helpful to draw a clear line between steering and rowing. Steering is deciding. Steering is avoiding obstacles and ensuring a successful journey. Steering requires faith; of a higher power, of self, of certain and eventual success. Rowing provides the motion. Rowing is action, implementation, and calls for a different kind of faith; a faith in the captain. The slave's faith begins and ends with you, her Master. If she begins to question your decisions, even innocently, she is sewing the seeds for an eventual loss in faith. You *must* prevent this at all costs.
 
At times when your slave is testing you, it is important to wait her out and administer discipline. Nothing proceeds or moves forward until she has resumed the role - the one she really wants anyway.

One of the most destructive and energy-neutralizing choices you can make is to meet in the middle and compromise with your slave. To trade away your sexual and energetic polarity in the interests of fair-mindedness and compromise and progress.
 
A Master is reasonable and fair, but there is a greater principle at work than "reasonable" and "fair". Too many relationships and too much love has been lost to fairness, reasonableness, and equality. Put another way: do you want a relationship full of crazy-making sexual energy, zeal, and passion - sometimes explosively so - or would you rather live out your long years with a very reasonable platonic friend? Those are your choices.

> ## Friends row together; Masters steer.

If the choice is between courteous correctness and energetic polarity, choose to protect the energetic polarity and let fairness and reasonableness be the first to fall in defense of passion. When your slave begins to bargain, plead, complain, *bitch*, moan, whale, suggest, hint, plant seeds, manipulate, mumble, grumble, cajole, butter up, freeze out, or anything else less than a happy and willing *Yes, Master*, issue strict punishment (more about that later), even if she has a great point. Great points will soon yield to good points, and good points will soon yield to mediocre points, eventually resulting in the neutralization of your energetic polarity. There is a time and place for your slave to make humble suggestions that would please her Master. Mid-command is not the time.

So again, remember this...
