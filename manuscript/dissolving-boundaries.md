# Dissolving Boundaries

If you spend much time styding philosophies of power exchange, it won't take long to stumble across the term *boundaries*. Further study will reveal a division between *soft* boundaries and *hard* boundaries -- that is, boundaries which can reasonably be changed with time (soft), and those which are unlikely to ever change (hard).

A core principle of Queare is this:

> ## Great Masters dissolve all boundaries

Another relevant core principle:

> ## Do no permanent physical, emotional, or mental harm to your slave

A third princple that applies in this section:

> ## Masters clear the path; slaves tend the path

Taken together, most boundaries become soft from the perspective of the Master. Permanent bodily injury and lasting emotional trauma aside, your job is to work with your slave to disslove whatever boundaries you face. That is part of clearing the path.

Which boundaries must be dissolved is left as an exercise for you to decide based on your specific desires in this world. A boundary that is blocking a slave from something you never plan to do is not a threat. All other boundaries must be dissolved.

In my experience, slaves want to be freed from their boundaries. Fear binds them so tightly though, that it can not be admitted but in the softest whispers in the darkest of night. Most slaves will, in some form, admit that they wish for *total* power exchange and *total* domination, instead of a lesser version where they have a safety button they can press to stop the ride. There is, quite simply, a level of surrender and bliss that is unattainable while the slave feels that any part of her is still being held back in reserve; that she is not fully committed to surrendering this moment. That feeling is to a slave an itch that she can't scratch. A deep and wounding restlessness that eats away from within her most secret core. You must vanquish that willful core, or she cannot be fully released into ascendance and will ultimately lose respect for you, that you could not *tame* her.

Furter, most boundaries are born of fear. Fear, as we know, is *False Expectations Appearing Real*. Therefore, the essence of dissolving aboundary is to remove the fear surrounding it. Fear can manifest as embarrasment, worry of physical harm, a broken heart, loss of income, or simply greater dependence on her Master than she is ready to surrender.

Common fears of slaves include: fear of certain sexual acts, particularly those that leave them incapacitated with their very lives in your hands, such as breath play; fear of losing love (jealousy of other slaves); fear of losing polarity.

The last fear - loss of polarity - could be said to be the original fear. The thing the slave fears more than anything else is that she will come to hate her Master or take her will back into her own hands. This fear, I have found, has little to do with any specific command or desire held by the Master. The fear is more general, that the Master will conduct himself or lead her in a way that leaves her feeling disconnected, unpolarized, or without purpose. By practicing the art of commanding from love, a Master can dissolve most fears before they begin.

Sometimes, though, the only way to clear a boundary is to push through the fear. You will need to decide when it is appropriate to push through a fear vs. working at it more gently. In my experience only, I have found that discussing fears tends to make them bigger. I suggest making your slave write her fears down and give submit them to you. This neuters the fears of their power and allows the slave to relax, knowing that she has submitted her fears to you and no longer needs to tend to them.

When dissolving a boundary, it is critical that the slave experience deep connection with you after crossing through the fear or boundary. Most slaves will follow you through a boundary crossing willingly once or twice. If you fail to prove a deep connection on the other side of the boundary, the slave will withdraw and lose respect. One of the easiest ways to lose a slave is to carelessly cross a boundary and leave her feeling disconnected. Be mindful that, when you cross a boundary, the result must be a deeper connection.
