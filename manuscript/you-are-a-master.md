# You Are a Master

Yours is to conquer the manifested. The physical world -- with help from your slaves.

Fear nothing. Learn from other masters. Become a master teacher. Generate abundance and provide protection to your slaves. To accept her surrender of the manifested, her flesh, that she may blossom and connect fully with the other realm and bring forth its virtues to you. For this exchange, she will bring the other realm to you and bathe you in beauty.

Masters love to guide, teach, and build. slaves are the finest of clay to be moulded to the Master's purpose. This simple exchange of masculine and feminine energy is the ultimate goal of Querae. In a perfect Queraen world, you and your slave could ascend to 100% masculine Master and a 100% feminine slave -- pure energy of each type, mixed together to create insane, explosive, passionate love. Whether you can reach this nirvana of perfection in our default world is beside the point; it is the goal for which we all strive, Master and slave alike.

Your role is to bring your slave, and therefore you, as close to ascendence as possible without visiting upon them permanent physical, emotional, or mental harm. You must be brave enough to oppose your slave's protests and fear-obstacles if you want to deliver the bliss you have promised her. In the other book, *s*, I am telling your slave the very same thing; that her Master *must* push her beyond comfort, through pain and fear, to reach the bliss. She knows this and expects nothing less from you.
