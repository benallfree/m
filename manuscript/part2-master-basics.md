2 -# Mastering the Basics

# You Are a Master

Yours is to conquer the manifested. The physical world -- with help from your slaves.

Fear nothing. Learn from other masters. Become a master teacher. Generate abundance and provide protection to your slaves. To accept her surrender of the manifested, her flesh, that she may blossom and connect fully with the other realm and bring forth its virtues to you. For this exchange, she will bring the other realm to you and bathe you in beauty.

Masters love to guide, teach, and build. slaves are the finest of clay to be moulded to the Master's purpose. This simple exchange of masculine and feminine energy is the ultimate goal of Querae. In a perfect Queraen world, you and your slave could ascend to 100% masculine Master and a 100% feminine slave -- pure energy of each type, mixed together to create insane, explosive, passionate love. Whether you can reach this nirvana of perfection in our default world is beside the point; it is the goal for which we all strive, Master and slave alike.

Your role is to bring your slave, and therefore you, as close to ascendence as possible without visiting upon them permanent physical, emotional, or mental harm. You must be brave enough to oppose your slave's protests and fear-obstacles if you want to deliver the bliss you have promised her. In the other book, *s*, I am telling your slave the very same thing; that her Master *must* push her beyond comfort, through pain and fear, to reach the bliss. She knows this and expects nothing less from you.

# Masters Don't Row

> I like to think that Master and I are in a boat together. On most days, I row and Master steers. He decides what is to be done, or where we will go, and I provide him the power to get us there. Master chooses the route, he makes sure the way is clear, and I tend to it. That relationship is the one that works best, the one where I am happiest too. I don't have to worry about whether the direction is right or wrong, I just happily row.
But every once in a while, I start thinking. I get clever. I get *smart*. I say, "Master, this is working pretty well. Why don't we switch for a while? How about you row and I'll steer?" And so I stop rowing. The boat stalls and settles adrift, aimlessly. "Master," I exclaim, "you have to row now! We are adrift!" And Master answers gently, "Master doesn't row."
So you see, when I get a mind to think how things should be, or where we should be going, what we should be doing, how I should be treated, or anything else, we just go nowhere because Master doesn't row. My ideas do have power and value, but only through Master when he steers and I row.    
 *-slave penny*
 
 The above is a meaningful and real story. It contains a lot of wisdom. As Master, your role is to choose the path and clear obstacles from it. Your slave will test her boundaries both intentionally and untentionally. She may at times complain that the path is not clear, when in fact it's just that the path is not easy. Your slave may, at times, become critical of the path you have chosen or what you have commanded her to do.
 
First, it would be helpful to draw a clear line between steering and rowing. Steering is deciding. Steering is avoiding obstacles and ensuring a successful journey. Steering requires faith; of a higher power, of self, of certain and eventual success. Rowing provides the motion. Rowing is action, implementation, and calls for a different kind of faith; a faith in the captain. The slave's faith begins and ends with you, her Master. If she begins to question your decisions, even innocently, she is sewing the seeds for an eventual loss in faith. You *must* prevent this at all costs.
 
At times when your slave is testing you, it is important to wait her out and administer discipline. Nothing proceeds or moves forward until she has resumed the role - the one she really wants anyway.

> ## If you row, you both lose.

One of the most destructive and energy-neutralizing choices you can make is to meet in the middle and compromise with your slave. To trade away your sexual and energetic polarity in the interests of fair-mindedness and compromise and progress.
 
A Master is reasonable and fair, but there is a greater principle at work than "reasonable" and "fair". Too many relationships and too much love has been lost to fairness, reasonableness, and equality. Put another way: do you want a relationship full of crazy-making sexual energy, zeal, and passion - sometimes explosively so - or would you rather live out your long years with a very reasonable platonic friend? Those are your choices.

> ## Friends row together; Masters steer.

If the choice is between courteous correctness and energetic polarity, choose to protect the energetic polarity and let fairness and reasonableness be the first to fall in defense of passion. When your slave begins to bargain, plead, complain, *bitch*, moan, whale, suggest, hint, plant seeds, manipulate, mumble, grumble, cajole, butter up, freeze out, or anything else less than a happy and willing *Yes, Master*, issue strict punishment (more about that later), even if she has a great point. Great points will soon yield to good points, and good points will soon yield to mediocre points, eventually resulting in the neutralization of your energetic polarity. There is a time and place for your slave to make humble suggestions that would please her Master. Mid-command is not the time.

So again, remember this...

> ## If you row, you both lose.

# Defending Your Castle

The truth is, Masters make mistakes. The hallmark of a great Master is not perfection, but how he handles his imperfections. What he does with the mistakes he makes. This is a great way to measure a Master.

However, a Master's castle cannot withstand attacks from within. That is not how castles work. They are strong from the outside. When you take a slave, you let her inside the castle walls. Once inside, the castle is vulnerable to attacks, even inadvertant ones. It is necessary that you must be vulnerable to your slave in order to Master her and receive the energetic benefits she gifts to you. But when your slave begins to feel willfulness or have *good ideas*, it represents an enemy within and must be dealth with swiftly. As discussed in the previous section, willfulness neutralizes energetic polarity. It brings the slave more into the masculine and out of the feminine. That, in turn, brings the Master more into the feminine. Once the two meet in the middle, all is lost.

Even when your slave is right with a helpful suggestion, she is wrong to attempt to modify your command. Sometimes, modifications can be disguised as clarifying questions. For example, consider the following conversation with your naked slave:

> You: slave, please go fetch today's newspaper from the driveway.
slave: Yes, Master. Now?
You: Yes slave, now please.
slave: Would it please you to have me put on a robe first?
You: No, slave. Go fetch the paper.
slave (peeking out the door): Yes, Master. Should I wait until nobody is around?

This is an example of an enemy inside the castle walls. The slave, perhaps well-meaning, is over-complicating the command, but it is disguised as submissive clarification. She never says no, and yet the command has been delayed. When was the first sign of trouble?

The first sign of trouble was in the slave's first response. When she asked *Now?*, it started an energetic neutralization. Though it might appear that the Master remained strong in this exchange, the slave actually won -- but lost a little respect for the Master. Multiply this exchange by a dozen per day for a few years, and neutralization will have reached its full effect. The relationship will be over.

Now, consider an alternate, more subtle version:

> You: slave, please go fetch today's newspaper from the driveway.
slave: Yes, Master. *Slave puts on a robe, then walks outside and retrieves the paper.*

Here again, the slave has disobeyed but in a more subtle way. She improvised aspects of the command by adding to it. The Master did not say *put on your robe and go fetch the paper*. The Master said simply, *go fetch the paper*. It is your role to teach your slave to be mindful of your exact command and not add her own interpretations to it. *How unreasonable,* you might say, *that I must specify every command exactly! What an order, I can't go through with it! I want a slave who thinks, who knows my preferences, and complies in a way that she believes will please me!* Perhaps this is true, however, it is far better to teach your slave to follow commands exactly than to give license for interpretation. Interpretation leads to judgement, and judgement leads to ego and willfulness. Imagine further:

> You: slave, why did you put your robe on first? I gave you a simple command.
> slave: Forgive me, Master. I thought it would be pleasing to you.

Now where are you? You have arrived at a virtually unfixable situation. Either you tell your slave that her judgement was wrong, which builds resentment because her judgement has ultimately been shaped by you (i.e., she views her lapse in judgement as your fault), or you accept the outcome, which further cements her eventual willfulness. The only way to salvage this situation is to punish her after the fact, which is known to be less effective because she was allowed to get away with the full measure of the disobedience. In essence, she robbed the bank and got caught, but did not have to give back the money.

As I discuss further in another section, your slave should be trained always to execute the *simplest* interpretation of your command - not because it is always desired, but because it is *always* a correct path to submission and surrender. Any other execution of a command is fraught with risk.

Therefore, I suggest the following version of the interaction:

> You: slave, please go fetch today's newspaper from the driveway.
> slave: Yes, Master. Now?
> You: *Don't say a word; instead, go get her leash and fasten it to her collar.* Now you will crawl, my love, and fetch the paper with your mouth. I will lead you through this command. Then, you will spend the rest of your day crawling and may not rise until you are commanded. Use this time to fully appreciate the importance of following my commands without question, the first time, in the simplest way possible. Now make your Master proud and comply without another word.

Whether the above punishment is the correct and effective measure for your slave is an exercise I leave to you. However, the point stands: the slave did not respond to the command with immediate blissful submission, and so corrective action was taken to enforce the command instead of entering into discussion with the slave. The Master made his alternative less appealing than following the original command.

While this may seem like an overreaction to a simple infraction or misunderstanding, your slave must learn absolutely that your word must be heeded immediately and competely without delays, questions, or embellishment. 

In order for your slave to be fully of service to you, you must be vulnerable to her. Teach your slave to be mindful of this at all times. A slave's willfulness and *good ideas* are the enemy within. When she begins second guessing her Master, or worse, believing she knows better than her Master, it takes her away from the feminine unmanifested bliss that you you promised to deliver her. Her confidence drops. She may even begin to believe that *Master doesn't care about the details*, which is a seed of eventual relationship failure.

Some may react to the suggestions above with resistence. You might think, *no, that is too mean; I don't want to treate my slave that way*. I urge you to study this section intensely until you come to understand that radical enforcement of simplest command execution is a kindness, not a disservice. Do not allow misunderstood ideas of *fairness* or *justice* to interfere with your much larger goal of a lasting and unconditional love between Master and slave. Justice and fairness can be addressed over time. The most fair and just Master is he who demands unquestioning and immediate compliance with his commands. On this point, there can be no ambiguity in your slave's mind or the relationship will ultimately fail.

You may also wonder, *but what if I was wrong? What if I did make a mistake? What if my slave was right?* Set that aside. A Master's mistake can always be addressed at a later point. In the singular moment of the command, Master is right even when he is wrong.

There are times when, as a Master, you may mistakenly push your slave past a boundary. She may be unready, unable, or unwilling to comply with your command. If this is the case, please consider my radical suggestion: *follow through with the command anyway, if possible*. To be very clear, I am suggesting that you force your slave past her boundary if possible. For even this temporary boundary crossing is minor relative to the loss of polarity created by a disboeyed command. In Querae, a Master must never bring permanent physical, mental or emotional harm to a slave. To be sure, crossing a slave's boundary is the most extreme of mistakes and I am not advocating or suggesting that Masters do it intentionally. But some some day it will happen to you because mistakes are made, and when it does, the castle is under attack from within. The slave *must* be brought to compliance, or the greater purpose is lost.  Temporary physical and emotional upheaval is a price well paid to see a command through when the alternative is loss of energy polarity. After the command has been completed, at a time of calm reflection, you can sit down with your slave and explain the error you see and how you intend to fix it in the future. I write about boundaries extensively elsewhere; this paragraph is not the whole story.

If your slave absolutely cannot or will not follow a command short of permanent physical or emotional harm, then be ready to issue a severe punishment that you feel is greater than the command requested. My suggestion is to help your slave feel that her boundary is the enemy, rather than her Master, and that confronting the boundary proactively with her Master will lead to more peace of mind and submission.

In summary, the above suggestions may need alteration for your particular slave and situation. Remember that there is a greater purpose at work than any one wrong command or sum of wrong commands, any one boundary or sum of boundaries. Your slave can forgive a Master's error, but she cannot forgive a Master's weakness or doubt. The higher purpose of which I speak is that of maintaining blissful polarity and attraction. Yours is to command absolutely, fearlessly, and to disallow any encroachment of questioning or judgement by your slave. Demand from your slave the dignity of succeding or failing on your own terms. Set aside discussion or feedback time, when out of command mode, to discuss your slave's ideas and alternatives. Teach your slave that, while in command, she will follow you to the ends of the Earth to share in your abundance. A good Master will have a plan the slave can understand. A better  Master may have a plan the slave can't yet understand. A great Master will have a plan the slave does not *need* to understand. When a slave begins comparing and judging her Master's commands, think of it as pouring poison into the well.

It's worth noting, too, that testing you through disobedience is a dangerous game for a slave to play. Not because of punishment - that would be fine if it always ended there. The dangerous game is that, some day, with enough persistence, you will miss a step and your slave will win a small victory. You will make a mistake, and she will be left in charge in that moment. And in that moment, she may find that she has lost a little respect for you. This respect can never be recaptured, never be restored. If a slave presses you long enough and hard enough, *she will eventually end up in charge*. And then, you have lost everything.

Make no mistake; the slaves will ultimately overcome the Masters. The castle walls will crumble, for everything is dust in the end. Your objective is to stay the erosion of such habits long enough that you and your slave die from old age before there is so much as a crack in the castle walls.

The honor and reverence of the Master/slave relationship is shared by both. It is as much your duty as it is your slave's to defend the relationship against all threats, including the biggest threat of all: your slave's willful mind.

# Dissolving Boundaries

If you spend much time styding philosophies of power exchange, it won't take long to stumble across the term *boundaries*. Further study will reveal a division between *soft* boundaries and *hard* boundaries -- that is, boundaries which can reasonably be changed with time (soft), and those which are unlikely to ever change (hard).

A core principle of Queare is this:

> ## Great Masters dissolve all boundaries

Another relevant core principle:

> ## Do no permanent physical, emotional, or mental harm to your slave

A third princple that applies in this section:

> ## Masters clear the path; slaves tend the path

Taken together, most boundaries become soft from the perspective of the Master. Permanent bodily injury and lasting emotional trauma aside, your job is to work with your slave to disslove whatever boundaries you face. That is part of clearing the path.

Which boundaries must be dissolved is left as an exercise for you to decide based on your specific desires in this world. A boundary that is blocking a slave from something you never plan to do is not a threat. All other boundaries must be dissolved.

In my experience, slaves want to be freed from their boundaries. Fear binds them so tightly though, that it can not be admitted but in the softest whispers in the darkest of night. Most slaves will, in some form, admit that they wish for *total* power exchange and *total* domination, instead of a lesser version where they have a safety button they can press to stop the ride. There is, quite simply, a level of surrender and bliss that is unattainable while the slave feels that any part of her is still being held back in reserve; that she is not fully committed to surrendering this moment. That feeling is to a slave an itch that she can't scratch. A deep and wounding restlessness that eats away from within her most secret core. You must vanquish that willful core, or she cannot be fully released into ascendance and will ultimately lose respect for you, that you could not *tame* her.

Furter, most boundaries are born of fear. Fear, as we know, is *False Expectations Appearing Real*. Therefore, the essence of dissolving aboundary is to remove the fear surrounding it. Fear can manifest as embarrasment, worry of physical harm, a broken heart, loss of income, or simply greater dependence on her Master than she is ready to surrender.

Common fears of slaves include: fear of certain sexual acts, particularly those that leave them incapacitated with their very lives in your hands, such as breath play; fear of losing love (jealousy of other slaves); fear of losing polarity.

The last fear - loss of polarity - could be said to be the original fear. The thing the slave fears more than anything else is that she will come to hate her Master or take her will back into her own hands. This fear, I have found, has little to do with any specific command or desire held by the Master. The fear is more general, that the Master will conduct himself or lead her in a way that leaves her feeling disconnected, unpolarized, or without purpose. By practicing the art of commanding from love, a Master can dissolve most fears before they begin.

Sometimes, though, the only way to clear a boundary is to push through the fear. You will need to decide when it is appropriate to push through a fear vs. working at it more gently. In my experience only, I have found that discussing fears tends to make them bigger. I suggest making your slave write her fears down and give submit them to you. This neuters the fears of their power and allows the slave to relax, knowing that she has submitted her fears to you and no longer needs to tend to them.

When dissolving a boundary, it is critical that the slave experience deep connection with you after crossing through the fear or boundary. Most slaves will follow you through a boundary crossing willingly once or twice. If you fail to prove a deep connection on the other side of the boundary, the slave will withdraw and lose respect. One of the easiest ways to lose a slave is to carelessly cross a boundary and leave her feeling disconnected. Be mindful that, when you cross a boundary, the result must be a deeper connection.
