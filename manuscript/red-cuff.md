# Clearing the Path for Your Slave

You must learn to clear the path for your slave. As she faces obstacles in her surrender, you must clear them. My experience is that external obstacles such as workplace resistance are far easier to overcome than internal obstacles such as the slave's emotional barriers or limiting beliefs.

As you work with your slave, begin to take note of the obstacles and type: internal or external? They must be handled differently. External obstacles involve using your powers to manifest outcomes and manipulate this physical world so that your slave's path to surrender is clear and unobstructed. This may mean helping your slave to switch jobs, change living situations, or even remove negative energy and influences from her life.

While external obstacles are "out there", they take a toll inside your slave. If left unattended, external obstacles can manifest into an internal obstacle or deep resentment in your slave. This type of emotional pain and blockage is much harder to remove. Whenever possible, clear external obstacles quickly and permanently. This alone will grow your bond with your slave, who will begin to trust her Master for solutions that require strength and fearless action.

Clearing internal obstacles is one of the ultimate goals of the Master+slave bond. The feminine energy absorbs negativity far differently than the masculine. The masculine responds as a body would to an infection: defenses go up and the negative energy is routed from the body. Masculine takes defensive action. The feminine energy bonds with negativity and begins to manifest it internally. Remember, the feminine is linked to the unmanifested. A simple suggestion sent to the unmanifested sets into motion a cascade of manifestation. If, for example, you comment that your slave is getting fat - guess what? It will manifest. If a well-meaning friend mentions to your slave that she is getting old - guess what? She will become older.

Clearing internal obstacles requires abundant love and patience from you. She must see you consistently clear external obstacles and feel your protection. Eventually, she will open and allow you to begin clearing her internal obstacles. Clearing an internal obstacle will most often appear to be an outpouring of pain or guilt, which you must absorb from her. She must clear this negative energy from her space before she can receive your positive love and guidance to fill it.

After your slave lets go of an internal obstacle, she will need to feel your strength and protection even more, while the void heals and is filled with your mastery. In essence, the slave is surrendering those beliefs and thoughts to you which were previously blocking her from higher service. Take them from her gently, and be willing to provide extra protection while she fills that space with unmanifested bliss.

To clear an internal obstacle, creativity is key. Think of gentle ways to allow your slave to begin viewing and approaching the internal obstacle objectively. Allow her to play with it, to find its boundaries, all under your protection and guidance. Tell her up front that you will not allow harm to come to her in this exploration. Though she may unearth icky feelings, you are and will remain her Master through this growth period.

In this book, I discuss many specific and common obstacles and specific strategies to eliminate them. When those strategies fail, and they sometimes will, refer back to this section to re-center yourself to the broader goal. Invoke your own creativity to follow the principles set forth here to come up with new approaches to overcoming obstacles. When you find one, share it with me and you may find it in a future edition of the book.

Once an internal or external obstacle is cleared, it is <em>yours</em> and <em>yours alone</em> to defend against future similar invasions. Particularly with an internal obstacle, your slave will likely <em>always</em> be susceptible to relapse. Your role, now until you are dust, is eternal vigilance to protect your slave from the manifested. To relax into her bliss and true form, she must have complete trust and knowledge that you will defend her while her back is turned from the manifested so that she can look into the unmanifested and bring it forth for you.

Do not underestimate the importance of your role in finding and clearing obstacles for your slave, and then defending that space.

# Leashing Your slave for the First Time

A leash and collar is an important spiritual training tool to help your slave break through to submission and higher purpose. It is also one of the easiest and most basic actions you can take with your slave to begin teaching her that she can surrender the physical to you and relax into service.

The leash and collar work in concert to create the foundation of one of the most enduring and unbreakable bonds this physical world has to offer. The leash provides a sense of external connection to a Master. It teaches the slave that she is always in reach of the Master, and serves as a physical tethering to her Master - one she can touch and feel. The collar provides a sense of belonging, of being owned. Both the leash and the collar serve critically in aiding the mental transformation a slave must undergo to release her most authentic self and open to you.

Physical presence is important. It's not enough to simply tell a slave that she is connected to and owned by you. She needs to feel it on her. She needs to become used to the presence of a leash and collar. It seems like a simple symbol, but in fact it gently introduces her to one of the most fundamental aspects of slavery: thinking of her Master first.

If you have any doubts that the physical leash and collar will begin changing thought patterns, you need only wear it yourself for a week or two. You will soon discover just how many times you must think of it. Taking clothes on and off becomes more complicated because the leash is dangling in the way. Moving through doorways is troublesome because the leash might get caught in the door. Even rounding a corner too quickly in the kitchen could catch the leash loop on a drawer handle. The collar feels fine at first, but after a while it becomes a point of focus too. Perhaps it becomes itchy. Perhaps it catches on skin when you turn your head to one side. Need to go to the bathroom? Watch that leash. Need to take a walk in public? Better think about hiding that leash (or just displaying it proudly, which I recommend). Airport TSA? Leash. Collar. And on and on.

Here is the key concept to understand: while the above may seem like minor inconveniences to you, and ones that you would solve easily, they have a *spiritual* and *transformational* effect on the slave's mind. She begins to think of her leash and collar before her every move. In essence, she begins to think of her Master before her every move. Eventually, and quite beautifully, the slave will come to integrate thoughts of the leash and collar into her subconscious. Over time, the adjustments made for the leash and collar will become automatic, as will the many other adjustments she makes for you over her lifetime.

The leash and collar are the first of many bonding experiences. The bonding experience is bilateral - meaning, you are bonding with your slave too. You may find your heart warming to your slave as you observe her obedience to your command. But even more, observing the way she honors her connection to you will begin to open your heart in a way only a slave can.

I recommend beginning with this simple exercise by setting a goal with your slave, as follows:

* Week 1: Wear the leash and collar for 2 hours per day
* Week 2: ...and at night
* Week 3: ...and whenever home
* Week 4: ...and whenever not working
* Bonus week 5: ...24 hours per day

Week 5 is a bonus because, while it is recommended, I recognize that it is not always practical. That said, you and your slave will experience higher ascendence and faster if you can fully live out the truth of your new bond with each other. Allow your lives to transform and adapt to your new truth.

Continue to strive for the Week 5 bonus until you achieve it, even if it takes years. If your slave has a job that won't allow the leash and collar, it is *yours (_not_ her's)* to work on manifesting a way of living that provides your slave the space and freedom to live in full bliss and connection.

This exercise also signals a subtle invocation of a major responsibility as a Master. You must learn to clear the path for your slave. As she faces obstacles in her surrender, you must clear them. We discuss this in detail in another section. For now, practice mindfulness that when she comes to you with either emotional or practical difficulties in wearing her leash and collar, hear her words as submission of obstacles and a signal that you are being called to activate your powers as Master to clear them.
